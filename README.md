# Machine_Learning

This repository mainly includes two projects I have done for FRE7773 machine learning class, one using Machine Learning and the other using Deep Learning. 

## Bankruptcy_oya
This project is to predict if the company will bankrupt in next year. I utalized PCA to decrease the dimension of features, and SMOTE to deal with the imbalanced data set. Then I fitted lots of models, such as LogisticRegression, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree Classifier, and GaussianNB, and selected best performmed model among these.

## Ships_in_satellite_images_P2
This project used CNN to define if there are ships in satellite images. I constructed converlutional neural networks, including four converlutional layers, maxpooling layers and a head layer.
